### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently reading:         Hegel's Ladder (H S Harris)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:        [Programming Languages](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages) offered by University of Washington 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Coding projects, ml and llm, data science, functional programming, or anything interesting
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:     A game dev project, 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:                  "speculative logic"
- ðŸ“« You can reach me:              Here.
- âš¡ Fun fact:                      Before we attempt the cognition of what is fun, it seems 
                                    reasonable to ask whether facticity is possible. Perhaps there is a special
                                    mode of cognition for it. But scepticism about it seems more reasonable, because 
                                    if our cognition is an instrument it must affect what it is used on (which is 
                                    therefore not fact but thought by virtue of conformity 
                                    to inner subjective sensibility); and if cognition is a passive medium, then what we know 
                                    is "what is" qua "fact." Can we knowingly undo this qualification of "what is"? 
                                    Then it is "unknown" again. Can we regard cognition as "drawing near" 
                                    to the fact? Then it could escape unless it is necessarily with us already; 
                                    and if the "medium" refracts it, then the "correction" would give just a 
                                    straight ray (of activity, a glipse) or a blank space (for the object qua fact).
                                    And for fun, well, I have a pet bird :)
